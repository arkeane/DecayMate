DecayMate is a modern iOS application and widget utility designed to calculate the radioactive decay of isotopes based on standard half-life data. Built entirely with SwiftUI, it allows users to track their sources in real-time.

## Features
* **Live Tracker:** Pin a source and watch its activity decay in real-time via the app or Lock Screen (Live Activities).
* **Decay Calculator:** Compute remaining activity at a future date, or reverse-calculate how long it will take to reach a target activity.
* **Target Activity:** Plan logistical operations by determining the exact initial dose required to reach a specific target activity at a later time.
* **Custom Isotope Manager:** Comes pre-loaded with standard isotopes (Tc-99m, F-18, etc.) with the ability to add and manage custom radionuclides.
* **Home Screen Widgets:** Monitor your pinned radioactive source directly from your iOS Home Screen.
